# Team Contract

**This is currently using the sample team contract. Delete the text in this section one done**

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure
similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork
experience, answer these questions.

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main
branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should
resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your
entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is
designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness
assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

1. The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.
2. If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.
